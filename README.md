## About This Project

In reality, there was no real need to implement microservices. InmoIT is intended to help a large Real Estate company provide information on properties in the United States and thus gradually increase rents and sales. For this, a well-designed monolithic application would also work without any inconvenience, clearly taking into account that the API and the user interface would be separated to offer better opportunities in the future (Clients).

The API, ASP.NET Core 5.0 was my obvious choice. The WebAPI application is focused on modularity to improve the development experience. Entering the subject, I divided the application into logical modules such as flow, Identity, Documents, Leases, Sales, etc. Each of these modules contains its own `controllers / interfaces / dbContext`. As for the database providers, mssql will be used as default `appsettings`. A module cannot communicate directly with another module or modify its table. CrossCutting concerns would use `interfaces / events`. And yes, domain events are also included in the project using mediatr Handler. Each of the modules follows a clean architecture design.

## Modular Architecture

Modular Architecture is a software design in which a monolith is made better and modular with the importance of reusing components / modules. The same implemented in InmoIT helps to be extended to support and operate with n-modules.

### PRO

- Clear Separation of Concerns
- Easily Scalable
- Lower complexity compared to Microservices
- Low operational / deployment costs.
- Reusability
- Organized Dependencies

### CONTRA

- Not Multi-technology compatible.
- Horizontal Scaling can be a concern. But this can be managed via load balancers.
- Since Interprocess Communication is used, messages may be lost during Application Termination. Microservices combat this issue by using external messaging brokers like Kafka, RabbitMQ.
- We can make use of message agents but no, let's keep it simple.

## Project Structure

- Take a look at the [structure][structure-url] of the solution

## Project Status

- API - `In Progress`
- Docker - `In Progress`

## Prerequisites

1. Install the latest [.NET 5 SDK][dotnetdownload-url]
2. Install the latest DOTNET & EF CLI Tools by using this command:

```
 dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef
```

3. Install the latest version of Visual Studio IDE 2022(v17.0.0 and above) OR [Visual Studio Code][vscode-url].
4. Install the latest [Docker on Windows][dockerwininstall-url]
5. It's recommended to use MsSql Server Database as it comes by default with InmoIT.
6. As for quick DB Management, me love [Azure Data Studio][azuredatastudio-url]

## Getting Started

To get started, here are the avaiable three options: download, clone or fork.

- Download ZIP.
- Open GitBash and execute command for clone:

```
git clone https://github.com/vladperchi/InmoIT.git
```

You would probably need to take this approach if you want to keep your source code upto date with the latest changes.

- Make a fork of this repository in your Github account. Use this if you want to always keep your version up-to date with the latest changes.
- Create your new `InmoIT` personal project by cloning the forked repository on your personal github.
- Setup an upstream remote on your personal project pointing to your forked repository using command `git remote add upstream https://github.com/{githubuseraccount}/InmoIT` and `git remote set-url --push upstream DISABLE`

## Running the API

- Open PowerShell `InmoIT/src/server` directory and execute:

```
docker-compose -f infrastructure.yml up -d
```

Note: It will start the required infrastructure in the background.

- Browse to https://localhost:8081 to Seq Logs!.

Then you can continue the list listed below:

1. Open up `InmoIT.sln` in Visual Studio 2019, preferably VS2022.
2. Navigate to appSettings.json under `src/Host/Api/appsettings.json`
3. Add you MsSql connection string under `PersistenceSettings`. The default connection string:
   `"mssql": "Data Source=.;Initial Catalog=InmoIT;Integrated Security=True;MultipleActiveResultSets=True"`
4. That is all you need to configure the API. Just create and run the API project.
5. By default, the database is migrated. Take a look at the [migrations][migrations-url] of the solution
6. Some default data is also included in this database, such as roles, users, owners, properties, images etc.
7. Browse to https://localhost:5001/ to Api InmoIT!

## Default Roles & Credentials

As soon you build and run your application, default users and roles get added to the database.

Default Roles are as follows.

- `SuperAdmin`
- `Admin`
- `Staff`

Here are the credentials for the default users.

- Email - vlaperchiwon@inmoit.com / Pass: @SuperAdminP4$$w0rd#
- Email - camilosoto@inmoit.com / Pass: @AdminP4$$w0rd#
- Email - davidvanegas@inmoit.com / Pass: @BasicP4$$w0rd#

You can use these credentials to generate JWT tokens in the `api/identity/tokens` endpoint.

<!--## Docker in Windows

- Install Docker on Windows via `https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/`
- Open up Powershell on Windows and run the following
  - `cd c:\`
  - `dotnet dev-certs https -ep $env:USERPROFILE\.aspnet\https\aspnetapp.pfx -p YourStrong(!)Passw0rd`
  - `dotnet dev-certs https --trust`
  - Note - Make sure that you use the same password that has been configured in the `infrastructure.yml` file. By default, `YourStrong(!)Passw0rd` is configured.
- 5005 is the port setup to run InmoIT on Docker, so make sure that these port is free. You could also change the port in the `docker-compose.yml` and `Server\Dockerfile` files.
- Now navigate back to the root of the InmoIT Project on your local machine and run the following via terminal
  - `docker-compose -f 'infrastructure.yml' up --build`
- This will start pulling MSSQL Server Image from Docker Hub if you don't already have this image.
- That's almost everything. Once the containers are available, migrations are updated in the MSSQL DB, default data is seeded.
- Browse to https://localhost:5005/ to use your version of InmoIT! -->

## HTTP requests can be sent to the API?

- You can find the list of all HTTP requests in [InmoIT.Postman][postmancollection-url], file placed in the directory `InmoIT\postman`.
- This file is compatible with [Postman][postmandownload-url] and easily edited with [Visual Studio Code][vscode-url].
